objects are a fundamental data structure used to store and manipulate data. They are a collection of
 key-value pairs where keys are strings  and values can be of any data type, including 
 other objects. Objects are an integral part of the language and are used to represent complex data structures,
 including arrays, functions, and more , object can be created by using object constructor  can add new properties to an object or modify existing
JavaScript engines represent objects as collections of key-value pairs in a structure called a "property map" or "dictionary."
This makes objects highly flexible, as you can add or remove properties dynamically.bjects in JavaScript are reference types, which means when you assign
 an object to a new variable or pass it as a function argument, you are working with a reference to the same object in memory.

 example:-

 const person{
    name: "jhon",
    age:23,
    email: "thisismyemail@gmail.com",
    address:"india"
 }

 

 console.log(person.name);
 console.log1(person.age);
 console.log(person.email);
 console.log(person.address);


 output:-
"jhon"
 23
"thisismyemail@gmail.com"
"india"
